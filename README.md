# zkVerify-qa

This repository contains quality assurance tools and tests for the zkVerify project, including end-to-end (E2E) tests and RPC tests.

## Supported Proofs

The list of supported proofs can be found within the zkverifyjs ProofType enum.

## Adding new proof type

When a new proof type is added to `zkverifyjs`:

1. Update zkverifyjs package version to latest
2. Add proof data file to `src/tests/common/data` give it the same name as it's given in ProofType enum.
3. Add additional `SEED_PHRASE` variable to `.env.testnet.rpc`
4. Search for `ADD_NEW_PROOF_TYPE` in the code and update the sections referenced
5. Add new `QA_SEED_PHRASE_` variable to `.secrets`
6. Add new `QA_SEED_PHRASE_` line to `name: Run RPC tests` section of `.github/workflows/CI-rpc-tests.yml`

## Send Proof

To send a newly generated proof of a specific type, run:

```shell
npx ts-node src/send-proof/index.ts <proofType> <waitForPublishedAttestation>
```

Example:

```shell
npx ts-node src/send-proof/index.ts groth16 false
```

## RPC Tests

RPC schema and valid/invalid proof submission tests.

For more details, refer to the [rpc-tests README](./src/rpc-tests/README.md).

To run RPC tests:

```shell
npm run test:rpc:testnet
```

## E2E Tests

The E2E tests spin up a complete local environment including:

1. Anvil Ethereum node
2. Three zkVerify nodes (local_node, node_alice, node_bob)
3. SubQuery infrastructure (Postgres, SubQuery node, GraphQL engine)
4. Attestation bot

It submits proofs and checks if attestation is collected and posted to Ethereum.

For more details, refer to the e2e-tests README.

To run E2E tests:

```shell
npm run test:e2e
```

### CI Workflow for E2E Tests

We use GitHub Actions to run our E2E tests automatically. The workflow is defined in [.github/workflows/CI-e2e-tests.yml](.github/workflows/CI-e2e-tests.yml).

Key features of the CI workflow:

1. **Triggered by**:

   - Manual dispatch (workflow_dispatch)
   - Workflow call (workflow_call)

2. **Customizable Inputs**:

   - zkverify_tag: Docker image tag for zkverify
   - zkverify_branch: Branch for zkVerify repository
   - attestation_bot_branch: Branch for attestation bot
   - zkv_contracts_branch: Branch for zkv attestation contracts

3. **Main Steps**:

   - Checkout code
   - Set up Node.js
   - Install dependencies
   - Run setup script (cloning latest repos)
   - Set up Docker containers
   - Wait for Ethereum contract deployment
   - Run E2E tests
   - Parse test results
   - Clean up Docker resources

4. **Test Result Parsing**:
   The workflow parses the test output to determine the number of passed, failed, and skipped tests.

5. **Environment Variables**:
   The workflow sets and uses various environment variables, including the deployed contract address.

## GitHub Actions Workflow with Act

Act allows you to test GitHub workflow changes locally.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running on your Mac.

### MacOS Installation and Setup

1. **Install Act**:

   ```sh
   brew install act
   ```

2. **Configure Act**:

   ```sh
   echo '--container-architecture linux/arm64' > ~/.actrc
   echo '--container-daemon-socket /var/run/docker.sock' >> ~/.actrc
   ```

3. **Docker Settings**:

   - Open Docker Desktop.
   - Navigate to **Preferences** > **Advanced**.
   - Tick the option **"Allow the default Docker socket to be used (requires password)"**.

4. **Set Up Docker Socket**:

   ```sh
   sudo ln -s ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/docker.raw.sock /var/run/docker.sock
   sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock
   ```

5. **Start Docker**:

   ```sh
   open /Applications/Docker.app
   ```

6. **Update Secrets File**:
   Update the [.secrets](.secrets) file with the require environment variables

   - QA_SEED_PHRASE: We can keep as is.
   - QA_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: Required to send notifications to the Slack channel
   - GH_TOKEN: Your personal [GH token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with permissions required to clone the zkVerify and attestation-bot repositories
   - DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME: Permissioned account required to pull private docker images
   - DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN: Permissioned account required to pull private docker images

### Running Act

Run the following command from the parent directory to test your ALL GitHub Actions workflows locally:

```sh
act workflow_dispatch -P ubuntu-latest=ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest --network host
```

To run a specific workflow pass in the `j` flag with the job name of the workflow, e.g.:

```yaml
jobs:
  rpc-build-and-test:
```

Would be:

```sh
act workflow_dispatch -j rpc-build-and-test -P ubuntu-latest=ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest --network host
```

> NOTE: To avoid rebuilding the images in each run, we can temporarily comment the cleanup step in [.github/workflows/CI-e2e-tests.yml](.github/workflows/CI-e2e-tests.yml)
> NOTE: The network flag is used to connect the act container to the host network so the services can communicate with each other.

This setup allows you to test and debug your GitHub Actions workflows locally before pushing changes to the repository.

## Tips

To catch any error before running the tests, we can perform some checks:

1. Check if the `local_node` service is running and doesn't have any errors. You should see something like this in the logs:

   ```bash
    2024-09-17 14:00:13 2024-09-17 12:00:13 zkVerify Mainchain Node
    2024-09-17 14:00:13 2024-09-17 12:00:13 ‚úåÔ∏è  version 0.5.1-814335572eb
    2024-09-17 14:00:13 2024-09-17 12:00:13 ‚ù§Ô∏è  by Horizen Labs <admin@horizenlabs.io>, 2024-2024
    2024-09-17 14:00:13 2024-09-17 12:00:13 üìã Chain specification: ZKV Local
    2024-09-17 14:00:13 2024-09-17 12:00:13 üè∑  Node name: RpcNode
   ```

   If not, see Troubleshooting section in [./src/e2e-tests/README.md](./src/e2e-tests/README.md#L106)

2. Check if the `local_node` service is listening on the correct port (default is 9944)

   ```bash
   curl -s -f -X POST \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"system_health","params":[],"id":1}' \
   http://localhost:9944
   ```

3. Check if the `subquery-node` is running without errors

   - If is returning the error `ERROR Having a problem when getting finalized block Error: Latest Finalized Height is not available` and stopping the workflow, that's because the `local_node` is not finished syncing, you can comment the `docker compose down -v` from [.github/workflows/CI-e2e-tests.yml](.github/workflows/CI-e2e-tests.yml#L95) and execute the workflow again.

4. Check if the `attestation-bot` is running and dosen't have any errors
   - If returning `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'query') {}` could be a problem with the initialization order of the services. Check the list of `depends_on` in the docker-compose file and make sure they are started in the correct order.
   - If the service get stuck in the `Waiting for contract data file to be ready...` check the `anvil-node` logs and double check the volumes, sometimes we need to clean up the volumes.
